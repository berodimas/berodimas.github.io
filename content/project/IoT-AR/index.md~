#### **Introduction**
In the process of caring for plants need to pay attention to several factors that influence the process of caring for these plants, for example factors of temperature, soil moisture, the need for radiation or intensity of light used, and other factors. To simplify these activities, an effective applicative innovation is needed that can be packaged in an informative, educative, and interactive manner. Therefore, this research was conducted which aims to create a prototype system to supervise and control the greenhouse in real-time by utilizing augmented reality as an interface, with control parameters such as lightning control and airflow control, and monitoring parameters in the form of: air and soil humidity, light intensity, and temperature. "Greenhouse Control and Monitoring System based on the Internet of Things with Augmented Reality Interface" is one of the interdisciplinary innovations between electronics, informatics, and agriculture.

#### **Scope of Problem**
1. Monitoring parameter: humidity, temperature, light intensity, moisture
