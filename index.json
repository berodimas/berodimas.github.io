The object that wants to be recognized in this study is the face of a person who wants to enter a door that has been configured with a \u0026ldquo;smart lock\u0026rdquo; system device in a building. The person who wants to enter the door can interact with the device using voice commands, such as: opening the door, repeating facial recognition, and asking permission from the access holder. This permission concept applies Internet of Things (IoT) technology, where permission requests to access holders will be sent via Bot on the Telegram application. Access can be given from anywhere as long as the access holder\u0026rsquo;s cell phone is connected to the internet.\nScope of Problem  Voice commands that can be performed such as: opening the door, repeating facial recognition, and asking permission from the access holder; The communication protocol on the Internet of Things used is the IEEE 802.11 or Wi-Fi standard; Face recognition using the Support Vector Machine method.

Education in accordance with future needs will only be realized if there is a shift or change in mindset in the learning process, with several points including: from one direction to interactive and from a single tool to multimedia tools. Thus, the authors conducted research on design of multimedia learning with the help of robot assistants. Multimedia learning contains material about the solar system, designed on the basis of marker based augmented reality using the Vuforia SDK in the form of Universal Windows Platform applications that are built on personal computer devices. The robot assistant is designed on a humanoid robot, with embedded intelligence that has the ability to detect and recognize text, using EAST Text Detector and Tesseract OCR, on the multimedia screen in the form of a planet name and the ability to find the fastest path to the destination planet to press buttons on the multimedia screen to change the augmented display reality planet. The entire design was tested and implemented at CoppeliaSim and managed to get a 100% accuracy and success rate.\nScope of Problem  Multimedia AR designed based on marker based tracking, in desktop application form, build on Microsoft Surface Pro 4; Robot Assistant implemented on Humanoid Robot, planted embedded intelligence/artificial intelligence; Testing is carried out on CoppeliaSim Simulator.  Scope of Embedded Intelligence  Able to detect (EAST Text Detector) and recognize (Tesseract OCR) text on multimedia screen (planet name); Able to find the shortest path to the destination planet (Shortest Path Algorithm in CDLL Data Structure).

To simplify these activities, an effective applicative innovation is needed that can be packaged in an informative, educative, and interactive manner. Therefore, this research was conducted which aims to create a prototype system to supervise and control the greenhouse in real-time by utilizing augmented reality as an interface, with control parameters such as lightning control and airflow control, and monitoring parameters in the form of: air and soil humidity, light intensity, and temperature. \u0026ldquo;Greenhouse Control and Monitoring System based on the Internet of Things with Augmented Reality Interface\u0026rdquo; is one of the interdisciplinary innovations between electronics, informatics, and agriculture.\nScope of Problem  Monitoring parameter: humidity, temperature, light intensity, moisture; Control parameter: PWM Fan and RGB LED; Communication protocol on Internet of Things using IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi).
